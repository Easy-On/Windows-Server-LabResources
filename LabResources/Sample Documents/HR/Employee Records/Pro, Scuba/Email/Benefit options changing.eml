Our company is growing and we have all seen our share of changes and =
growing pains as we stretch to become the best at what we do. This is =
why I am glad to announce that we have recently reorganized our benefits =
program and are able to actually offer an upgrade to our employees. =
Through this reorganization we have changed providers to a company that =
offers significantly better coverages at slightly lower rates while =
keeping the same customer satisfaction levels as our previous provider.
