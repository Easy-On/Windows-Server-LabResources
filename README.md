# Windows Server LabResources

These are various lab resources that are meant to be used together with the [Windows Server Lab Guides](https://github.com/Easy-On/Windows-Server).

They are downloaded automatically by the start script of the course setup. But they can be updated at any time by running ````C:\Labs\WS2025\Update-LabResources.ps1````.
